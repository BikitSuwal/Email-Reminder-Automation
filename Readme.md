# 📬 Email Reminder Automation
### 📬 Project Description
Email Reminder Automation is a simple Python-based automation tool that sends scheduled reminder emails using Gmail. The program uses the smtplib library to send messages and can be run either locally with a scheduler like schedule, or fully automated in the cloud using GitHub Actions.

The goal is to automate routine reminders — like daily motivation or hydration nudges — without needing to keep your computer running. It uses secure app-based Gmail authentication and can be configured to run on a custom schedule (e.g., daily at 9 AM).

This project is ideal for beginners learning Python, automation, and DevOps concepts like CI/CD with GitHub Actions.


## 🚀 Features

- ⏰ Daily scheduled email delivery
- 🔐 Secure credentials using GitHub Secrets
- 🐍 Lightweight and built in pure Python
- ☁️ Runs entirely in the cloud — no need to keep your machine on
